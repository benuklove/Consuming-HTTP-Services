00:01 Finally, let's talk about queuing. 
00:03 We are not going to cover queuing in this class, 
00:06 but if we are taking the survey of the range of possible ways 
00:10 of communicating with services, queuing probably shouldn't be left out. 
00:12 So queuing is typically done sort of behind the firewall, right. 
00:16 So I've got a set of apps they are running behind the firewall, 
00:20 one of them is going to get some sort of operation, 
00:23 it's going to add some kind of work or message to the queue 
00:27 later on asynchronously another app might pick that up and do something. 
00:32 So for example, "hey I am a web server, 'Will you send an email to this person?', 
00:35 and I am going to carry on serving up my web pages." 
00:38 Some other sort of email work or process might grab that go "yeah sure, 
00:42 I will start the outbound email campaign to this person." 
00:45 That is queuing, we are not going to cover queuing in this class, 
00:48 but just to round down the spectrum there you have it.

00:02 We've worked with a number of the text data types. 
00:07 Now, let's talk about binary data, so again we are going to use Requests, 
00:10 but this time we are going to focus on downloading and saving, 
00:14 or even in-memory processing binary data, 
00:17 this could be things like zip files, it could be images or a whole bunch of stuff, 
00:23 In the demo, we are going to do is actually mp3 files. 
00:26 Those are fairly large binary files that we can work with. 
00:29 So a lot of things with Requests are really straightforward, 
00:32 this one is a little less straightforward, 
00:34 but not too bad once you see a couple of techniques 
00:37 that will make this much easier.

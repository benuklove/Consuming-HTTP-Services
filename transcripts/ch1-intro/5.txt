00:00 Finally, we are going to write a lot of code in this course.
00:03 Well, I am going to write a lot of code in this course, and hopefully you follow along.
00:07 It would be great when you see me doing these demos, for you to say, 
00:10 'Okay, I am going to take basically the idea that I saw Michael do there, 
00:13 and I am going to write that.' 
00:15 All of the APIs, in fact, that we are working with
00:17 are public and out in the open. 
00:20 So, even the ones where we have to modify data are publicly accessible. 
00:23 I've created some special ones for this course, 
00:26 so you should be able to write the code and follow along in examples. 
00:30 So I strongly encourage you to have your own little projects, 
00:34 your own set of Python apps that is more or less replicating what I am doing here, 
00:39 but I do have the source code of exactly what I typed 
00:43 on the screen available to you here at github. 
00:46 It's consuming_services_python_demos on my github account,
00:50 and I encourage you right now to go star and/ or fork that repository 
00:55 so you have it as part of your record.

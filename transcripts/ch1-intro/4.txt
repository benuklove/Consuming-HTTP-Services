00:00 We are also going to be using a API exploration tool called Postman, 
00:04 so Postman is a cross-platform GUI for interacting, analyzing 
00:09 and just generally recording and playing with APIs. 
00:13 We won't make heavy use of it. 
00:16 You don't have to install it if you don't want to play with it, 
00:19 but I find working with APIs sometimes is great to get a good understanding 
00:22 and play with it and then implement it in code, 
00:25 and you'll see me do that a few times in the course, 
00:27 and we are going to be using Postman so Postman is cool, and free, 
00:30 so it's worth checking out.

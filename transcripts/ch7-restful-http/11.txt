00:01 In our service, to update a blog post, 
00:04 we are going to do an HTTP PUT to the particular URL 
00:07 that represents that blog post, and the body of that post is going to contain 
00:12 the details in JSON form to replace the value on the server. 
00:15 So we want to do a put/api/blog/id and pass the title and the content, things like that. 
00:21 The response is going to be just an HTTP status code 204, no content, 
00:25 everything worked, thank you. 
00:28 In code, what does that look like? 
00:30 Well, we start by creating a dictionary that is going to be the body of our post, 
00:33 so updated post details, we are going to pass title, content, view count and published. 
00:37 Now, not all of these necessarily changed, so it's up to you 
00:41 and really up to the API to determine whether you have to pass all the values back 
00:46 or just the ones that are changing, I believe the API we are working here 
00:49 requires all the new values to be passed or it will like null them out on the server. 
00:54 So, we are going to pass them all but it could be possible if you just want to change the title
00:58 you might just have to pass the title, that is up to the API. 
01:01 Then we come up with the post_url that we are going to update, 
01:05 API/blog the id of that post, and then what we do is we do a requests.put.
01:10 So we send a PUT request, or HTTP request with a PUT verb to that URL 
01:14 and we pass the JSON body as the updated post details, 
01:18 remember, that is going to take the dictionary and convert it to a JSON string 
01:21 and set the content type of the put to be application/json. 
01:27 And then of course we want to check the status code, and make sure that worked,
01:31 in our case, the contract we have with the servers 204 is good,
01:35 everything else not good, but you might want to be on the lookout for 200 as well 
01:38 if they not carefully managing their status codes in the response, 
01:42 and if that worked, then, yeey, we're all good, now we can just assume
01:45 that that post was updated as we specified.

00:02 Let's take a moment and discuss the HTTP and RESTful building blocks. 
00:06 So where are we in our course? We are back sort of focused generally on the HtTP clients. 
00:10 So what are the building blocks that make up these HTTP services 
00:14 and to an even larger degree RESTful services? 
00:17 You'll see that RESTful services technically are like a specialization of HTTP services.
00:22 They are basically HTTP services with a certain number of criteria. Not all HTTP services, 
00:28 maybe most, don't actually support every RESTful principle let's say. 
00:33 So what are the building blocks? Well, obviously, the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. 
00:37 These are things that transfer over the internet, 
00:41 over the same protocol that web browsers use.
00:44 And they focus on resources, so the way that you describe stuff in your API 
00:49 often is some kind of noun, or set of nouns 
00:53 and we have resources or URLs that point at these resources. 
00:57 So imagine we're basecamp. We might have users /api/users, 
01:02 we might have projects /api/projects, 
01:06 maybe a particular project so /api/project/7 or whatever, 
01:11 and then unlike the traditional remote method invocation type of services 
01:15 that are made up of verbs and actions, so things like 'get users', 'log in', and so on, 
01:20 we'll see that these HTTP services are built upon nouns. 
01:24 And the way that we perform actions on them is with the HTTP verbs, 
01:28 so we might do a GET again, /users/one, 
01:31 that means give me the details about user number one. 
01:34 Maybe we want to create a new user, so we do a POST against /users, things like that, 
01:38 so it's the HTTP verbs plus the nouns that are the resources, 
01:41 that together make up our HTTP services. 
01:44 Now, most services you run into, kind of stop there. 
01:47 If you are talking about RESTful services there is a couple more levels 
01:50 we got to go into. So you might have resource discovery. 
01:54 So APIs like basecamp and other sort of well known APIs github and so on,
01:59 they list exactly what their resources are, but certain types of RESTful services don't. 
02:04 They just say start here and we'll give you a bunch of URLs 
02:08 and then you can explore further, using those URLs, so that is resource discovery.
02:13 The other thing that we could do but many services don't,
02:17 is content negotiation, at a super low level,
02:19 maybe you've got a /users/one and you have the ability to either access that
02:25 and get the result back as JSON or as XML. 
02:28 So if you set the accept type header either in your client or your browser,
02:33 you are going to get whatever you put there, 
02:36 so JSON gives you JSON, XML gives you XML, you could even go so far to say 
02:40 I accept an image and it will give you the profile image back. 
02:42 But, most services really say, "You do this request, you get some JSON.
02:47 You do that request, you get some XML.", it's a little less dynamic 
02:50 but if you talk full RESTful services, this is typically part of what is included.

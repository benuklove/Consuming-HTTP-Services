00:02 Now, one of the challenges of writing this course is 
00:05 if we are going to modify data out on the internet, 
00:09 we are probably going to need to create an account 
00:12 and do all sorts of stuff with various people's APIs 
00:15 and I know that those APIs might change over time 
00:18 and I don't necessarily want to ask everyone to go create a github API 
00:23 and the access key and maybe modify their own github data, 
00:27 that might go terribly wrong somehow, I don't know how, 
00:29 but I just don't want to depend on these other services, 
00:31 and it's totally easy to find read only services out there 
00:34 that are publicly accessible without authentication. 
00:37 But, as we get into more complicated, more realistic interactions, 
00:40 we are going to need something we can bing on without that changing 
00:45 and without that ever becoming a problem. 
00:48 So I'd like to introduce you to the service that we are going to use 
00:51 for much of the rest of this course. Now this service has at least three aspects to it, 
00:56 we have this blog API here and as you can guess, 
00:59 we are going to just model a blog but it could be anything right, 
01:03 the blog part is just something to make it concrete. 
01:06 Here is an HTTP somewhat RESTful service and this is publicly accessible,
01:10 so if I click this we get JSON back. Now we also have a restricted version, 
01:14 we are not going to talk about authentication now, that is its own section, 
01:18 but when we get to it, you are going to see that this service requires basic authentication 
01:23 and so we'll learn how to do that from Python, how to access that service. 
01:28 We have not entered, by the way, if you want to see what it looks like, 
01:32 there is username and password it looks like this one, 
01:35 it just won't let you access it without logging in. 
01:37 So down here I have outlined the various operations, 
01:39 like you can get all the posts from the blog like this, 
01:42 you can you can get a particular blog post by going to api/blog/post id 7 or whatever. 
01:47 You can create a new blog post by doing an HTTP POST to /api/blog.
01:53 You can update an existing post by doing a PUT to that blog's specific resource id 
02:00 or that URL that goes to that blog and similarly you can DELETE it. 
02:04 Also we have a SOAP service here. 
02:07 Now we are going to leave the SOAP stuff to its own section,
02:10 just like we are authentication but the same service, 
02:12 the same set of services I guess we should call them, will do SOAP. 
02:16 So if we click on here you can see all the crazy stuff, 
02:19 we'll talk about what that means later but you can see 
02:22 that there is a set of operations that we can work with 
02:25 here that are more SOAP service like, they work in terms of nouns and actions, 
02:28 and they return rich objects as real objects, we'll come back to that so for now, 
02:34 what we are going to do is we are going to focus on api/blog and these operations. 
02:38 This is publicly accessible, consumer_services_api.talkpython.fm 
02:46 and you will be allowed, without even logging in, to modify the data here. 
02:51 It works in a pretty constrained way, so you can create some post 
02:54 and it won't be shared with other users, 
02:57 and they will expire after a little while, things like that. 
03:00 But this is a service that you can bing on and will use for much of the rest of this course.

00:01 Let me introduce you to the application that we are going to be using
00:04 throughout this whole modifying data section and even a little bit afterwards. 
00:08 And I am calling this the blog explorer. 
00:11 So it's using this service that we've already seen in the previous video, 
00:15 and this is our blog service and notice I am defining this base_url, 
00:19 the reason is we can also run this locally and we could switch this out 
00:23 like a localhost version which is included in the github repository with instructions 
00:27 how to set it up and run it and all those kinds of things. 
00:30 So if you are somewhere without internet, 
00:33 you can replace this with the local version and run that, 
00:36 So the idea basically is it's going to work around this concept of posts 
00:39 and a post is going to have id, title, content, 
00:42 it's going to have a published date, as a string and it's going to have a view count. 
00:46 So what we are going to do is we are going to write a little app, 
00:49 here you can see the main method and it's going to give you four basic options. 
00:52 You can show the post with a list command. 
00:55 You can add a new post with the "a" command. 
00:58 You can update a post with the "u" command 
01:02 and you can delete a post with the "d" command. 
01:04 Now, just be aware there is some preexisting posts 
01:06 which are shared by everybody who uses the service, 
01:09 and those you can't update, you'll get a message about that, 
01:11 but the ones you create you can update those and delete them. 
01:14 So what we are going to do next is we are going to work on getting this list post to work, 
01:19 you can see there is no real implementation other than this show bit here. 
01:23 So I'll go and run it and show you we can say I would like to list 
01:26 and it says 'TODO: GET POSTS' so because the get post is not implemented, 
01:29 there are posts to show. If I do update, or delete, all of those just say look, 
01:34 you got to write this, but this structure is in place for us to go to in the next set of videos, 
01:39 the one thing that totally works right now, you can exit.

00:04 where we are talking about HTTP clients doing nontrivial service work. 
00:08 So, as we've seen with Requests, it's really quite easy to do a basic GET 
00:13 against an open public URL. 
00:16 However, if we want to modify data, 
00:19 if we want to access authenticated request, things like that get more interesting, 
00:24 so right now we are going to focus in on modifying data using the HTTP verbs.

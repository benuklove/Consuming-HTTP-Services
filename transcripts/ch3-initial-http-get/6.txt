00:01 So that was simple, right? The whole promise of Requests 
00:04 is that it makes doing simple operations simple and easy and straightforward.
00:08 I certainly think that that operation fit the bill. 
00:11 We start by importing Requests, and then we just do 'get(url)'
00:16 to actually download the response. Now this is a blocking call. 
00:20 It's not going to return until we've actually gone to the server, 
00:22 looked up the DNS for talkpython.fm, done the GET, got the response, 
00:26 entirely downloaded it. So this is a blocking call, and we have response 
00:29 and it has both the status code set, so we also have headers and cookies 
00:33 and things like that, and we can access the text property. 
00:36 So here we are just printing out, here is the first 500 characters that we got, 
00:40 just to see what this was all about. 
00:42 Now this was really cool that we could go do this simple GET against the website, 
00:46 but what we want to work with are actually services, 
00:48 things that are meant to talk, computer to computer, 
00:51 program to program, not program to humans or program to browser to humans, 
00:56 however you want to think about it, so that is what we are going to do next.

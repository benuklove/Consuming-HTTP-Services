00:00 While HTML and text is really made for humans, 
00:03 that is not the focus of this course. The focus of this course is 
00:06 to consume data and formats meant for programs and computers. 
00:10 So, what does that include? Well, JSON is the most popular 
00:15 exchange format these days, especially around HTTP RESTful services.
00:18 Back when SOAP was popular XML was really important, 
00:22 and we still have XML being passed around, or think of things like RSS feeds. 
00:26 There is a number of older services that still use XML so we are going to work with that.
00:31 Obviously binary data is very often something we're gonna access and download, 
00:35 think of a zip file or an image or something and then
00:38 SOAP. We are also going to come back and look at SOAP, 
00:41 but for now, let's focus on JSON. So we are going to look at 
00:44 how we consume JSON services, obviously, but before we do that, 
00:48 I think the right place to start is for us, actually, 
00:51 to just do a little bit of work with JSON in Python and leave the network out of it.

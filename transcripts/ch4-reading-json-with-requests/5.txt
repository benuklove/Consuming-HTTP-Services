00:00 Let's review the core concepts about accessing JSON services with Requests. 
00:03 Of course we are going to start by importing Requests. 
00:06 I have to have the URL to the service that we are going to call. 
00:10 In this case, we are just going to do a basic GET. So we say 'request.get' given the URL, 
00:13 we get our response back and we've worked with this already,
00:16 but the thing that is new this time is we now can call '.json' 
00:20 and that will directly translate the text, 
00:23 string representation of Json into a Python dictionary 
00:27 and then we just work with the data in there. 
00:29 In our example, we got the clone URL for the get clone command 
00:33 from wherever repository we were pointing at in the API.

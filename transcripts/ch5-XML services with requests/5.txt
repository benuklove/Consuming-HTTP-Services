00:01 So to review, working with XML from services is pretty straightforward. 
00:04 Again, because it's the easiest way to do stuff on HTTP, 
00:07 we are going to work with Requests, 
00:10 and then, we are also going to use the ElementTree,
00:12 and we are going to call request.get given url, 
00:15 that is going to get us the response. Remember, 
00:17 check the status code - make sure everything worked out okay, 
00:20 and then we can get a hold of the actual XML as a string, via response.text 
00:23 and then we are going to use ElementTree and parse it as 'fromstring', 
00:27 and once we have that, we are off to the races. 
00:30 We now have an XML DOM in-memory and we just do xpath queries against it 
00:34 as we saw in the previous section.

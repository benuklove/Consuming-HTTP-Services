00:05 We are still going to be using HTTP clients. 
00:08 We are going to be using REST in particular,

00:16 We are going to focus on how to work with XML for basic read-only services. 
00:21 Now this is not SOAP. This is just straight up XML, 
00:24 Things like RSS feeds and other XML data sources out on the internet.

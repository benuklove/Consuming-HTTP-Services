00:02 Let's review working with XML in Python. 
00:05 We're not yet to the services part but that's actually the easy part. 
00:08 It's working with XML itself that can sometimes be tricky. 
00:12 So here we've got a little fragment of the data that came 
00:15 from that Reed college course catalogue that was reed.xml. 
00:18 You can see we have a title. We have days. We have building and room. 
00:21 And if we want to work with this, we go and import ElementTree, 
00:25 and just to make our lives easier, it wasn't technically necessary 
00:28 but it is better to create a named tuple 
00:31 which is more or less a class with fields only and no functions, 
00:35 which was all we really needed it was little data containers, 
00:38 and then we are going to parse that from the string representation of XML 
00:43 into the DOM, the object model.
00:46 We are going to use the 'fromstring' method on the ElementTree, 
00:49 and then we start writing xpath queries against it. 
00:52 So here we are looping over the find all of the courses, and for each course,
00:57 or each really node that we find in the XML document, we are going to run 
01:01 a set of subqueries on that document. So we are going to query for the title, 
01:04 for the place/building, place/room, 
01:07 and then in this example we're also getting the days that it runs. 
01:10 Then if we want the courses that are held in Eliot hall, or a building,
01:13 all we have to do is write a little list comprehension 
01:16 say give me the 'course for course in courses', 
01:19 these are the transformed named tuple types, where the 'building=eliot'. 
01:23 Boom, it's done. It's worth considering the trade-off of XML versus JSON 
01:29 and how it relates back to SOAP services. 
01:33 So SOAP is a much more strict, and honestly convoluted, protocol 
01:38 than simple XML exchange. 
01:41 So SOAP has envelopes and headers and a bunch of namespaces, 
01:45 and certain ways in which things must be structured, 
01:48 and XML is just much more general. There can be simple XML or complicated XML. 
01:52 So what we are doing and what we are going to do, for this section, 
01:55 is all about just working with plain xml data, not SOAP services,
02:00 SOAP services require tons of tooling and we'll work on that later, right, 
02:06 we'll see that Python actually has some decent answers to the SOAP story 
02:09 if you must use those services, 
02:11 but in this case, we are just working with straight XML. 
02:14 So, we are just focused on working with XML by itself. Now, if you get the choice, 
02:18 if you get to decide whether you have an XML service or a JSON service, 
02:22 choose JSON, it much more closely matches the way data is represented in Python 
02:28 and the way it's represented in Javascript.
02:31 So if you are building a web app and it's got a Javascript front end 
02:34 and a Python back end, JSON all the way, 
02:37 but, consuming XML is still not too bad as we've seen. 
02:39 So, let's go look at another example.
